                <p class="innerpara">
                    <b>CSS saves time: </b> You can write CSS once and reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages.
                    <br><b>Easy Maintainence :</b>To make a global change simply change the style, and all elements in all the webpages will be updated automatically.
                    <br><b>Search Engines :</b>CSS is considered as clean coding technique, which means search engines won’t have to struggle to “read” its content.
                    <br><b>Superior styles to HTML :</b>CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.
                    <br><b>Offline Browsing :</b>CSS can store web applications locally with the help of offline catche.Using of this we can view offline websites.

                <img src="image/javascript_logo.png" class="img1" title="JavaScript Image">
                <h3>What is JAVASCRIPT<h3>    
                <p class="innerpara">
                    JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
                    <br>The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
                    <br>Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
                    <br>In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.
                </p>
                <h3>Why Use JAVASCRIPT</h3>
                <p class="innerpara">
                    Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.
                    <br>React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.
                    <br>Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called AJAX and COMET technologies).
                    <br>Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
                    <br>Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).
