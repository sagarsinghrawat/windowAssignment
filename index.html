                <h3>What is C++</h3>    
                <p class="innerpara">
                    C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.
                    <br>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
                    <br>C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
                    <br>The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.

                <h3>Why Use C++</h3>
                <p class="innerpara">
                    C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.
                    <br>C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.
                    <br>C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
                    <br>C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
                    <br>C++ is fun and easy to learn!

                <br>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
                <br>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
                <br>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
                <br>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

                JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
                <br>The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
                <br>Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
                <br>In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.

                <br>Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called AJAX and COMET technologies).
                <br>Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
